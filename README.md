# Auth+

This project below is still in progress but already has a lot of my knowledge and experience. Since each of those systems is quite big, I just put the link. Each one of them has a detailed description. This project should simulate  a real organization as a Startup! All those projects must challenge me in a way: language, concepts, or tools.

## Pitch Deck

A lot of startups have a dilemma: The Build vs. Buy Dilemma. When deciding whether to develop a custom solution or integrate a third-party service, startups must weigh long-term flexibility against immediate speed to market.

### Developing a Custom Solution (Build)
Creating your own software from scratch offers maximum control but comes with significant hidden costs.

- Opportunity Cost: Every hour spent building a "commodity" feature (like a billing system) is an hour not spent on your core product.
- Resource Intensity: Requires significant engineering hours and high human capital investment.
- Technical Risk: Building from zero increases the likelihood of bugs, security vulnerabilities, and architectural mistakes.
- Total Cost of Ownership: You aren't just paying to build it; you are responsible for hosting, security patches, and updates indefinitely.

### Integrating Third-Party Services (Buy)
Using existing APIs or SaaS platforms allows for rapid scaling, but it limits your independence.

- Scaling Costs: Most services use a "pay-as-you-grow" model, which can become expensive as your user base expands.
- Integration Friction: While you aren't "coding" the feature, you still spend time mapping data and managing API dependencies.
- Rigidity: If the vendor doesn't support a specific feature you need, customizing it is often impossible or requires expensive enterprise tiers.
- Vendor Lock-in: Moving your data away from a third-party provider later can be technically difficult and costly.
